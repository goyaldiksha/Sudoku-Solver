# Sudoku-Solver
Given a 9*9 sudoku board, in which some entries are filled and others are 0 (0 indicates that the cell is empty), the program will find out whether the Sudoku puzzle can be solved or not. If it can be solved, it will output the solution board but if it is not possible to solve it will show the message.
